# Docker Notes
To exit a running container type Ctrl+p,q

# To run docker and map a port to the outside world.
# Basicall this runs the my_mongodb container and inside the container it exposes port 28017. This is MongoDB's default admin port.
# Then 27107 is the host's port from which I will route traffice to 28017. This routing will work only if I expose the host's external
# port with the the firewall tool (ufw, in this case.)
# /bin/bash is supposed to start a bash shell but for some reason it doesn't work in this case.
sudo docker run  -p 27107:28017 -i -t my_mongodb /bin/bash

# To rename an image, use the docker tag functionality

# To open a firewall port 21707
sudo ufw allow 21707/tcp

# To close a firewall port 21707
sudo uwf deny 21707/tcp
